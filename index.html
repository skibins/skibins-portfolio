								<p>Hello, I am <b>Janek</b>, a passionate enthusiast of new technologies and programming. My fascination with programming began during high school where I discovered the extraordinary world of coding. <b>The vision of participating in the development of technology and the world was my inspiration</b> along with my personal determination to explore new possibilities.</p>
								<p>My major passion is exploring the opportunities offered by technological advancements. <b>I'm particularly interested in artificial intelligence and IT solutions that simplify, enhance, and enrich daily life.</b> I also find the potential of augmented reality and virtual environments incredibly exciting as they reshape the ways we interact and engage with the digital world.&#128516;</p>
								<p>In the field of programming I particularly enjoy <b>Python</b>, but I'm also proficient in <b>Java</b>, <b>C++</b> and also <b>languages necessary for web development</b>. My long-term career goals focus on advancing in <b>Data Science</b> and creating and training <b>artificial intelligence</b>.</p>
								<p>As someone who enjoys solving logical problems and possesses an analytical mind I aim to continuously improve my programming skills.</p>
								<p>Feel free to check out my profiles on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-skibinski/" target="_blank"><b>LinkedIn</b></a> and <a href="https://github.com/skibins" target="_blank"><b>GitHub</b></a> where you can find more information about me and my projects.</p>

								<p>During my internship at EPLAN in Cieszyn I actively participated in a software development project contributing to the creation of a <b>book rental web application</b> within a collaborative team environment. This experience provided me with valuable insights into the software development lifecycle including <b>requirements gathering</b>, <b>design</b>, <b>implementation</b>, <b>testing</b> and <b>deployment</b>. The successful completion of this project showcased my ability to work effectively in a team and deliver high-quality software solutions.</p>
								<p>Subsequently, I returned to EPLAN as an intern in the following school year where I was involved in the development of an <b>employee-list application</b>. This project further enhanced my technical skills and allowed me to deepen my understanding of software architecture and database management.</p>
								<p>In addition to these major projects I have done several smaller projects <b>which are available for preview on my <a href="https://github.com/skibins" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a></b>. These projects encompass the range of technologies and demonstrate my versatility as a developer.</p>
								<p>Furthermore, I have proactively pursued opportunities for continuous learning and growth, both through my <b>university studies in informatics and through self-directed learning initiatives</b>. I am committed to staying abreast of the latest developments in the field of technology and continuously improving my skills as a software developer.</p>

								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I'm a passionate software developer with an interest in new technologies, AI, computers, and self-development. I graduated from the <b>High School of Wladyslaw Szybinski in Cieszyn</b> as a software developer. Now I'm a student at the <b>Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice</b>. Apart from my dedication to software development, I am also deeply passionate about cars, swimming, and saunas. 	&#128516; These interests provide me with relaxation and inspiration outside of my coding endeavors. Additionally, I consider myself a <b>sociable and extroverted individual</b>, enjoying interactions and connections with others in both professional and social settings. I am also interested in <b>project management</b>, <b>data science</b> and <b>cloud technologies</b>. &#128187;</p>
