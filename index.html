								<p>Hello, I am <b>Janek</b>, a passionate enthusiast of new technologies and programming. My fascination with programming began during high school where I discovered the extraordinary world of coding. <b>The vision of participating in the development of technology and the world was my inspiration</b> along with my personal determination to explore new possibilities.</p>
								<p>My major passion is exploring the opportunities offered by technological advancements. <b>I'm particularly interested in artificial intelligence and IT solutions that simplify, enhance, and enrich daily life.</b> I also find the potential of augmented reality and virtual environments incredibly exciting as they reshape the ways we interact and engage with the digital world.&#128516;</p>
								<p>In the field of programming I particularly enjoy <b>Python</b>, but I'm also proficient in <b>Java</b>, <b>C++</b> and also <b>languages necessary for web development</b>. My long-term career goals focus on advancing in <b>Data Science</b> and creating and training <b>artificial intelligence</b>.</p>

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>My journey in tech began with an internship at EPLAN in Cieszyn, where I worked as part of a <b>4-person team</b> on small-scale projects. My main focus was on <b>developing a book rental web application</b>, which introduced me to key phases of the <b>software development lifecycle</b>, from requirements gathering and design to testing and deployment. This experience provided me with foundational skills and showcased my ability to <b>collaborate effectively within a team</b>.</p>
								<p>As an <b>Embedded Systems Integration Engineer</b>, I expanded my expertise to both <b>hardware</b> and <b>software development</b>. My tasks included configuring systems, writing configuration scripts, and working on embedded solutions that demanded precision and a deep understanding of system architecture. This role allowed me to develop a holistic view of embedded systems and solidify my technical skills across multiple domains.</p>
								<p>Afterward, I took on the role of <b>Python Automation Developer</b>, where I gained experience in creating <b>applications</b> and <b>automation scripts</b>. My work in this position involved using <b>Python</b>, <b>Python Selenium</b>, and <b>PyQt</b>, allowing me to develop a strong understanding of <b>automation processes</b>, <b>UI development</b>, and <b>data handling</b>. This role deepened my knowledge of Python and honed my problem-solving skills.</p>
								<p>Currently, I am working as a <b>Software Engineer - Cloud Support</b>, where I manage and maintain cloud infrastructure within the SAP Commerce Cloud environment. This role has strengthened my skills in <b>cloud technology</b>, <b>system support</b>, and <b>troubleshooting</b>, enabling me to deliver reliable and scalable solutions. I am responsible for maintaining system stability, responding to technical issues, and ensuring that the platform operates smoothly for users.</p>
								<p>In addition to these major projects I have done several smaller projects <b>which are available for preview on my <a href="https://github.com/skibins" target="_blank">GitHub profile</a></b>. These projects encompass the range of technologies and demonstrate my versatility as a developer.</p>
								<p>Furthermore, I have proactively pursued opportunities for continuous learning and growth, both through my <b>university studies in informatics and through self-directed learning initiatives</b>. I am committed to staying abreast of the latest developments in the field of technology and continuously improving my skills as a software developer.</p>
